the process by which iteration approaches a destination that iteration itself defines. the [[tri-kernel]] iterates until [[focus]] stabilizes, [[neurons]] approach [[knowledge]], and the protocol approaches [[intelligence]]

convergence is one of the strangest things in mathematics. a system does something over and over, and somehow it arrives somewhere specific — not because anyone told it where to go, but because the structure of the operation leaves no alternative

---

## from zero: what convergence means

take a number. apply a rule. take the result, apply the rule again. keep going

example: start with any number $x_0$. apply the rule $x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2}(x_n + \frac{2}{x_n})$. this is the Babylonian method for computing $\sqrt{2}$

| step | value |
|------|-------|
| 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1.5 |
| 2 | 1.4167 |
| 3 | 1.4142157 |
| 4 | 1.41421356... |

by step 4, the answer is correct to 8 decimal places. nobody told the system what $\sqrt{2}$ is. the rule itself knows — because $\sqrt{2}$ is the only number the rule does not change. the [[fixed point]]

convergence means: repeated application of a rule approaches a state that the rule preserves. the destination is encoded in the dynamics

---

## three requirements

not everything converges. three conditions separate convergence from chaos:

### completeness — the destination exists

the space must have no gaps. every sequence that looks like it converges must actually have somewhere to converge to. this is what complete metric spaces guarantee

on the rational numbers, $\sqrt{2}$ does not exist. the Babylonian method would approach it forever, never arriving. on the real numbers, it converges in four steps. completeness means the answer exists in the space you are working in

the [[cybergraph]]'s probability simplex $\Delta^{|P|-1} = \{\phi \in \mathbb{R}^{|P|} : \phi_i \geq 0, \sum \phi_i = 1\}$ is complete. the [[focus]] distribution the system converges to is guaranteed to exist

### contraction — the rule reduces distance

each application of the rule must bring points closer together. if $T$ is the rule and $d$ is distance:

$$d(T(x), T(y)) \leq \kappa \cdot d(x, y), \quad \kappa < 1$$

this is the contraction property. $\kappa$ is the contraction coefficient — the fraction of distance that survives each step. at $\kappa = 0.5$, half the error disappears per step. at $\kappa = 0.9$, a tenth disappears. the exact value of $\kappa$ determines speed, but any $\kappa < 1$ guarantees convergence

why contraction implies uniqueness: if two fixed points existed, the distance between them would have to satisfy $d(x^*, y^*) \leq \kappa \cdot d(x^*, y^*)$. since $\kappa < 1$, this forces $d = 0$. there is exactly one

### closure — the rule stays in bounds

the rule must map valid states to valid states. a probability distribution must remain a probability distribution after the update. a positive vector must stay positive

the [[tri-kernel]] satisfies this: each operator preserves the simplex. [[diffusion]] is stochastic (rows sum to 1). [[springs]] with normalization stays on the simplex. [[heat kernel]] is positivity-preserving. the composite remains a valid [[focus]] distribution

---

## the hierarchy of convergence

convergence comes in strengths. each level adds guarantees:

### pointwise convergence

a sequence of functions $f_n(x)$ converges to $f(x)$ at each individual point, but the rate can vary across points. some parts converge fast, others slowly. weak — good enough for theoretical existence, dangerous for computation

### uniform convergence

$f_n \to f$ at the same rate everywhere. $\sup_x |f_n(x) - f(x)| \to 0$. convergence is predictable — you can bound the error globally after $n$ steps. the [[banach fixed-point theorem]] gives uniform convergence with geometric rate

### convergence in norm

the entire vector converges in a single measurement: $\|\phi^{(t)} - \phi^*\| \to 0$. this is what the [[collective focus theorem]] proves. the $L^1$ norm of the difference between current and final [[focus]] distribution shrinks geometrically:

$$\|\phi^{(t)} - \phi^*\|_1 \leq \frac{\kappa^t}{1-\kappa} \|\phi^{(0)} - T(\phi^{(0)})\|_1$$

### convergence in distribution

a sequence of probability distributions approaches a limit distribution. this is what [[diffusion]] achieves: the random walk distribution converges to the stationary distribution $\pi^*$ regardless of the starting distribution. the [[Perron-Frobenius theorem]] guarantees this for ergodic chains

---

## why convergence is strange

### the destination is not an input

nobody tells the system where to converge. the fixed point $\phi^*$ is a consequence of the rule $T$, not a parameter. change the rule — change the destination. the answer is implicit in the dynamics

in [[cyber]]: no one decides what [[cyberank]] should be. [[neurons]] create [[cyberlinks]], the [[tri-kernel]] iterates, and $\pi^*$ emerges. the ranking is a consequence of the graph structure, not a design choice

### convergence erases initial conditions

start anywhere in the space. after enough iterations, you arrive at the same point. the system forgets where it started. this is the ergodic property — the past becomes irrelevant

this is deeply counterintuitive. two systems with completely different initial states end up identical. the structure of the rule matters more than the history of the system. topology dominates initial conditions

in [[cyber]]: it does not matter what the first [[cyberlinks]] were, or which [[neurons]] acted first. the long-run [[focus]] distribution $\pi^*$ depends only on the current graph structure. history is absorbed

### convergence rate varies but convergence does not

$\kappa$ controls speed. $\kappa = 0.1$ is fast (ten-fold error reduction per step). $\kappa = 0.999$ is slow (a thousand steps for meaningful progress). but if $\kappa < 1$, convergence is mathematically certain. slow convergence is still convergence. the theorem does not care about patience

the [[spectral gap]] $\lambda$ determines $\kappa$ for the [[cybergraph]]. sparse graphs have small gaps (slow convergence). dense, well-connected graphs have large gaps (fast convergence). either way, the system converges

### convergence is stronger than proof

[[Goedel]] showed in 1931 that any consistent formal system contains true statements it cannot prove. derivation from axioms hits a wall. but convergence is not derivation. a contraction mapping finds its fixed point regardless of what formal logic says about it

a protein folds by minimizing [[free energy]]. no theorem of chemistry derives the fold. the protein converges to it. a market finds [[equilibrium]] price through trades. no axiom system derives the price. the market converges to it

the [[cybergraph]] finds [[collective focus]] by iterating the [[tri-kernel]]. no formal system derives $\pi^*$. the contraction mapping finds it. this is proof by simulation — the foundation of [[cybics]]

## five examples across substrates

### heat equation

a metal bar, hot at one end, cold at the other. heat flows from hot to cold. the temperature distribution converges to uniform — the unique state where no further flow occurs

this is [[diffusion]] on a continuous substrate. the [[Laplacian]] $\nabla^2 T$ drives the flow. the convergence rate depends on thermal conductivity and the bar's geometry. the steady state is the fixed point

### newton's method

find the root of $f(x) = 0$ by iterating $x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n)/f'(x_n)$. near a simple root, the convergence is quadratic — error squares each step. 3 correct digits → 6 → 12 → 24. four iterations give machine precision

the Babylonian method for $\sqrt{a}$ is Newton's method applied to $f(x) = x^2 - a$. convergence so fast it feels like cheating

### markov chains

a random walker moves through a graph. at each step, it jumps to a neighbor with probability proportional to edge weights. the distribution over positions converges to the stationary distribution $\pi^*$ satisfying $\pi^* = \pi^* P$

the [[Perron-Frobenius theorem]] guarantees convergence when the chain is irreducible (all states reachable) and aperiodic (no forced cycles). the [[spectral gap]] controls the rate. PageRank is this: a random walk with teleport on the web graph

this is Part I of the [[collective focus theorem]] — [[diffusion]] alone

### gradient descent

minimize $f(x)$ by repeatedly stepping in the direction of steepest descent: $x_{n+1} = x_n - \eta \nabla f(x_n)$. if $f$ is strongly convex and the learning rate $\eta$ is small enough, the iteration is a contraction. it converges to the unique minimum

neural network training is gradient descent on the loss function. the loss landscape is not convex in general — hence the difficulty. but when it works, the same principle applies: iteration reduces error until the system settles

### the tri-kernel

the [[cybergraph]]'s composite operator:

$$\phi^{(t+1)} = \text{norm}\big[\lambda_d D(\phi^t) + \lambda_s S(\phi^t) + \lambda_h H_\tau(\phi^t)\big]$$

three contractions combined:
- [[diffusion]] $D$: contracts with rate $\alpha$ (teleport)
- [[springs]] $S$: contracts with rate $\|L\|/(\|L\|+\mu)$ (screening)
- [[heat]] $H_\tau$: contracts with rate $e^{-\tau\lambda_2}$ (temperature × Fiedler eigenvalue)

the composite contraction coefficient:

$$\kappa = \lambda_d \alpha + \lambda_s \frac{\|L\|}{\|L\|+\mu} + \lambda_h e^{-\tau\lambda_2} < 1$$

convex combination of numbers less than 1 is less than 1. [[banach fixed-point theorem]] applies. $\phi^*$ exists, is unique, and every iteration gets closer by factor $\kappa$

---

## convergence and conservation

convergence does not happen in a vacuum. it happens under constraints. the most important constraint is [[conservation]] — something is preserved throughout the process

in the [[cybergraph]]: [[focus]] sums to 1 at every step. $\sum_i \phi_i^{(t)} = 1$ for all $t$. the [[tri-kernel]] redistributes focus but cannot create or destroy it. this is the analog of energy conservation in physics

conservation shapes the fixed point. without the constraint $\sum \phi_i = 1$, the system could collapse to zero or explode to infinity. conservation forces it onto the simplex, where the [[banach fixed-point theorem]] finds the unique [[equilibrium]]

in [[thermodynamics]]: energy is conserved, [[entropy]] increases, and [[free energy]] decreases until it reaches its minimum — the [[Boltzmann distribution]]. the [[tri-kernel]] fixed point minimizes the same kind of functional:

$$\mathcal{F}(\phi) = \text{energy terms} - T \cdot S(\phi)$$

the fixed point $\phi^*_i \propto \exp(-\beta E_i)$ is a [[Boltzmann distribution]] over [[particles]]. convergence under conservation produces thermodynamic [[equilibrium]]

---

## convergence and time

convergence creates an arrow. before convergence: uncertainty, multiple possible states, dependence on initial conditions. after convergence: certainty, one state, initial conditions forgotten

this arrow is real. the contraction coefficient $\kappa < 1$ means information about the past is lost at rate $\kappa^t$ per step. after $t \gg 1/\log(1/\kappa)$ steps, the system has effectively no memory of where it started

in [[thermodynamics]], this arrow is the second law: [[entropy]] increases until [[equilibrium]]. in [[cyber]], this arrow is [[foculus]] finality: [[focus]] distribution stabilizes until [[consensus]]

convergence time for the [[tri-kernel]]:

$$t_{\text{converge}}(\varepsilon) = O\left(\frac{\log(1/\varepsilon)}{\lambda}\right)$$

where $\lambda$ is the [[spectral gap]]. logarithmic in precision — doubling accuracy costs one additional step, not double the time

---

## convergence and locality

at planetary scale (10¹⁵ nodes), global recomputation per step is impossible. convergence must be local: each node reads only its neighbors, updates its own state, and the global fixed point emerges from local interactions

the [[tri-kernel]] satisfies this. for any edit batch, the effect decays with graph distance:
- [[diffusion]]: geometric decay via teleport
- [[springs]]: exponential decay via screening
- [[heat]]: Gaussian tail via bandwidth

[[locality]] radius: $h = O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ hops. beyond this, the edit is invisible up to error $\varepsilon$. global convergence from local computation — this is what makes [[collective focus]] computable on a planetary network

---

## convergence and truth

the deepest claim of [[cybics]]: [[truth]] is the fixed point of convergent simulation under conservation laws

not truth as logical theorem. not truth as social agreement. truth as stability — the state that survives iteration. what remains when everything that can change has changed

a [[particle]] with high [[cyberank]] is true in this sense: the [[tri-kernel]] keeps assigning it high focus. perturbations dampen. noise washes out. the signal persists because the graph structure supports it

a [[particle]] with low [[cyberank]] is false in this sense: the system pushes focus away from it. every iteration reduces its weight. it converges toward irrelevance

this is not [[consensus]] by vote. it is [[consensus]] by convergence — the same way a ball settles at the bottom of a bowl, not because it decided to, but because the geometry leaves no alternative

---

## the full picture

convergence in [[cyber]] ties together:

- [[banach fixed-point theorem]] — the mathematical guarantee (contraction → unique fixed point)
- [[Perron-Frobenius theorem]] — the positivity guarantee (ergodic chain → positive stationary distribution)
- [[spectral gap]] — the speed control (gap size → convergence rate)
- [[free energy]] — the variational view (fixed point minimizes $\mathcal{F}$)
- [[Boltzmann distribution]] — the [[equilibrium]] form ($\phi^* \propto \exp(-\beta E)$)
- [[locality]] — the scalability condition (local computation → global convergence)
- [[conservation]] — the constraint that shapes the destination ($\sum \phi_i = 1$)
- [[dissipative structures]] — the thermodynamic frame (order maintained by energy flow)
- [[convergent computation]] — the philosophical claim (computation = convergence, not derivation)
- [[cybics]] — the synthesis (proof by simulation)

convergence is the journey. [[equilibrium]] is the arrival. [[intelligence]] is doing it again and again, each time on a richer [[cybergraph]], each time with higher [[syntropy]]
